0=The Fool=Ballad of a Thin Man=The only knowledge you value is that given to you by others. Think for yourself, have your own opinions, don't follow leaders and watch your pawking meters.
1=The Magician=Quinn The Eskimo=Someone, probably you, has the power to transform your life into something more exciting and interesting. What are you waiting for? If you've got it, flaunt it!
2=The Priestess=LoveMinusZero / No Limit=The feminine principle of intuition, instinct and quiet reasoning shows the way and can provide wisdom and strength if you're willing to listen. It may not be fashionable, it may not be what's happening, but it's what is right for you.
3=The Empress=She Belongs to Me=You've got everything you need if you don't try too hard and don't question your innate abilities. You may not be as others but you have more to offer than that. All you need is belief in yourself.
4=The Emperor=Masters of War=Sometimes it is necessary to exercise a bit of muscle, exert some power or flaunt the male principle. Be aware of things escalating though, a rigid spine can quickly become rigor mortis of the spirit.
5=The Hierophant=Maggie's Farm=Wisdom will come from unconventional thinking or unexpected sources. What may not, at first, seem the obvious answer, will reveal itself in time.
6=The Lovers=Romance in Durango=Pay close attention to the one you love the most. He/she is supporting and helping you. The future may not have a happy ending and you may both make mistakes along the way but your union will be strong and you can (figuratively or possibly literally) die in each other's arms.
7=The Chariot=When The Ship Comes In=Some people are going to piss you right off. They believe you are less than you believe you are. They may be right, they may be wrong. Battle them anyway and try to prove your own beliefs.
8=Justice=Like a Rolling Stone=A good time to tell others (or yourself) a few home truths. Clear the air, set the record straight and, if necessary, play it fucking loud!
9=The Hermit=Blowin in the Wind=Life may seem complex. It may seem simple. It is out of your hands either way. So let whatever happens, happen.
10=Wheel of Fortune=Mr Tambourine Man=Exciting changes ahead. Positive, negative and sometimes a little scary. Either way you'll benefit from the experience.
11=Strength=Positively 4th Street=Now is the time to stand up for yourself and have the courage of your beliefs. You are right they are wrong. There is no more to say.

13=Death=The Times they are a Changin'=The times they are a changin'! What more explanation do you need?
14=Temperance=It's All Right Ma, I'm Only Bleeding=The world is crazy. You know it but there's little you can do so just keep on keeping on. The world needs your sanity.
15=The Devil=Desolation Row=Many temptations. Many short-term gains, goals, one night stands and one hit wonders. Your mood may improve for a while but the hangover is long and repentance is slow. Think long term or don't bother thinking at all.
16=The Tower=A Hard Rains a Gonna Fall=As George Harrison once said: 'Whatever you do is going to come right back on you.' And I don't think he meant it in a kind way.
17=The Star=I Want You=Don't be deterred by others. Stay bright and optimistic and pursue whatever your pursuing. You may win, you may not but you'll have a lot of fun trying.
18=The Moon=Visions of Joanna=A female or the feminine principle within you has a wisdom and depth you need to listen to.  Be guided by your (or her) intuition and advice. It may be a struggle but it will give peace and serenity in the end.
19=The Sun=New Morning=Things are looking good. Life is going to be sunny. Go for what you want, you'll get it!
20=Judgement=Don't Think Twice=What started off good may have gone sour in the past but you are aware of that. You have wisdom now and know that the road is still worth travelling even if the journey's not always smooth.
21=The World=Forever Young=The best card to draw if you listen to the upbeat track. Slightly depressing if you go for the dirgy version. Either way you are loved and respected and, by God, people like you! You cannot fail. And even if you do, there's no success like failure...
swords=1=I Shall Be Released=With optimism and fortitude a great struggle will be overcome.
swords=2=One Too Many Mornings=You can keep battering away at your goal but it won't be achieved and you'll never be satisfied. Try accounting. And if that fails - teach.
swords=3=Man of Constant Sorrow=There are those to whom all good things will come. You aren't one of them.
swords=4=If You See Her Say Hello=The time for action has past, you've lost what you wanted. You know it's too late. Regrets, you've got a few.
swords=5=Boots of Spanish Leather=You've been wronged and it hurts. Bide your time and smile, their own folly will help in your revenge.
swords=6=Tonight I'll be Staying Here With You=Stuff needs doing, goals need to be achieved, but take a rest, kick your shoes off and relax. You won't die, it's not poison.
swords=7=I Don't Believe You (Acts Like We Never Have Met)=Things are changing around you. What you thought was concrete has shifted into sand. There are no certainties so don't take things for granted.

swords=9=Dead Man Dead Man=You know your faults. You know your vices. You know you need to change. But will you? Can you?
swords=10=The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll=Life just isn't fair. Forget God, forget Karma, the good die young and the bastards always win. Something may be due to you, you may have earned it, you may deserve it, but you ain't gonna get it.
swords=Kn=Drifters Escape=Ingenuity and charm. All may seem to be going wrong but you have a gift for turning things right in the end.
swords=J=I am a Lonesome Hobo=Achievement by agile and wily methods. You will get results but not by conventional methods.
swords=Q=To Ramona=A sharing of sympathy. Tender moments, intimate conversation in candlelight and quietude.
swords=K=John Wesley Harding=A 'masculine' man, powerful and formidable. He could be good for you, temporarily, but beware of crossing him, he has his own sense of justice.
wands=1=All I Really Want To Do=People think you have ulterior motives. They may treat you with suspicion or feel you are untrustworthy. You need to convince otherwise. Perhaps your personality needs an overhaul.
wands=2=Joey=Think before you blink. You've bitten off more than you can chew and what you thought was simple is complex. You are out of your depth.

wands=8=Tears of Rage=Treachery surrounds you. Disappointment and frustration. All you thought was good will get smacked in your face.
wands=9=Dear Landlord=Your expectation of disappoinment gives you strength. A friend's actions will sadden rather than anger you.
wands=10=Ballad of Frankie Lee & Judas Priest=The thing you trusted is about to turn on you. Be it a person, situation or belief. Be prepared.
wands=Kn=Changing of the Guards=So much happening. Chaos. Fun. Excitement. It's all mixed up confusion. Don't worry things will settle and a picture will form.
wands=J=Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Thru Dark Heat)=People are relying on you too much. You don't want to let them down but their need is sometimes suffocating. You need more freedom and solitude.
wands=Q=Hazel=You are going for the unattainable. Stop it, you're wasting your time. Alternatively keep trying but try harder.
wands=K=Father of Night=An authoritative figure (possibly older) is there to guide you. He has a lot of wisdom to impart but beware you don't blindly follow. Be aware of what's good for you.
cups=1=If Not For You=Togetherness, partnership. Reveling in others company, particularly one special other. Life is good when life is shared.
cups=2=Isis=Drop the hip stance and realise you're not the only card in the deck. A perfect partner is waiting for you to catch up, so take the sun out of your eyes or wear shades (but not indoors!)

cups=4=True Love Tends to Forget=You've done something wrong. Admit it and just apologise for God's sake!

cups=7=Rainy Day Women #12&35=Laugh off your troubles with fun, friends and frivolity for a while - they will return so why not?

coins=2=All the Tired Horses=You are driving yourself and others too hard. Slow down. Yes you have an itch but too much scratching only results in blood.
coins=3=Trust Yourself=You have been let down, things have fallen apart. Strengthen your resolve and follow your intuition. You have feelings, use them.
coins=4=Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?=It seems everything is designed to annoy and irritate you. People piss you off, stuff gets in your way. You can't move for crap.

coins=10=Wedding Song=Contentment. Security in love and home surroundings. The spiritual is more important than the material.
